Q6TFL4,27798626,Stabilizing mutations of KLHL24 ubiquitin ligase cause loss of keratin 14 and human skin fragility.,"Skin integrity is essential for protection from external stress and trauma. Defects in structural proteins such as keratins cause skin fragility, epitomized by epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a life-threatening disorder. Here we show that dominant mutations of KLHL24, encoding a cullin 3-RBX1 ubiquitin ligase substrate receptor, cause EB. We have identified start-codon mutations in the KLHL24 gene in five patients with EB. These mutations lead to truncated KLHL24 protein lacking the initial 28 amino acids (KLHL24-ΔN28). KLHL24-ΔN28 is more stable than its wild-type counterpart owing to abolished autoubiquitination. We have further identified keratin 14 (KRT14) as a KLHL24 substrate and found that KLHL24-ΔN28 induces excessive ubiquitination and degradation of KRT14. Using a knock-in mouse model, we have confirmed that the Klhl24 mutations lead to stabilized Klhl24-ΔN28 and cause Krt14 degradation. Our findings identify a new disease-causing mechanism due to dysregulation of autoubiquitination and open new avenues for the treatment of related disorders.",autoubiquitination,"Stabilizing mutations of KLHL24 ubiquitin ligase cause loss of keratin 14 and human skin fragility.

Q92673,20015111,GGA autoinhibition revisited.,"The cytosolic adaptors GGA1-3 mediate sorting of transmembrane proteins displaying a C-terminal acidic dileucine motif (DXXLL) in their cytosolic domain. GGA1 and GGA3 contain similar but intrinsic motifs that are believed to serve as autoinhibitory sites activated by the phosphorylation of a serine positioned three residues upstream of the DXXLL motif. In the present study, we have subjected the widely acknowledged concept of GGA1 autoinhibition to a thorough structural and functional examination. We find that (i) the intrinsic motif of GGA1 is inactive, (ii) only C-terminal DXXLL motifs constitute active GGA binding sites, (iii) while aspartates and phosphorylated serines one or two positions upstream of the DXXLL motif increase GGA1 binding, phosphoserines further upstream have little or no influence and (iv) phosphorylation of GGA1 does not affect its conformation or binding to Sortilin and SorLA. Taken together, our findings seem to refute the functional significance of GGA autoinhibition in particular and of intrinsic GGA binding motifs in general.",autoinhibition,"GGA autoinhibition revisited.

P0A964,2068106,Bacterial chemotaxis signaling complexes: formation of a CheA/CheW complex enhances autophosphorylation and affinity for CheY.,"We have demonstrated that a complex of the proteins CheA (CheAL and CheAS) and CheW can be isolated and constitutes a functional unit that responds to the signaling state of the chemoreceptors. The autophosphorylation rate of CheAL is much greater when CheAL and CheAS are complexed with CheW. Moreover, the presence of mutant chemoreceptors that cause cells to tumble increases this rate. At wild-type levels of expression, the isolated CheAL/CheAS/CheW complex accounts for about 10% of the total number of CheAL, CheAS, and CheW molecules and exists in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry. This complex is also required for CheAL/CheAS and CheW binding to the phosphorylation substrate, CheY. A separate interaction between CheY and another chemotaxis component, CheZ, was also detected.

Q13557,14722083,"Comparative analyses of the three-dimensional structures and enzymatic properties of alpha, beta, gamma and delta isoforms of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.","Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-kinase II) is a ubiquitous Ser/Thr-directed protein kinase that is expressed from a family of four genes (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) in mammalian cells. We have documented the three-dimensional structures and the biophysical and enzymatic properties of the four gene products. Biophysical analyses showed that each isoform assembles into oligomeric forms and their three-dimensional structures at 21-25 A revealed that all four isoforms were dodecamers with similar but highly unusual architecture. A gear-shaped core comprising the association domain has the catalytic domains tethered on appendages, six of which extend from both ends of the core. At this level of resolution, we can discern no isoform-dependent differences in ultrastructure of the holoenzymes. Enzymatic analyses showed that the isoforms were similar in their K(m) for ATP and the peptide substrate syntide, but showed significant differences in their interactions with Ca(2+)-calmodulin as assessed by binding, substrate phosphorylation, and autophosphorylation. Interestingly, the rank order of CaM binding affinity (gamma > beta > delta > alpha) does not directly correlate with the rank order of their CaM dependence for autophosphorylation (beta > gamma > delta > alpha). Simulations utilizing this data revealed that the measured differences in CaM binding affinities play a minor role in the autophosphorylation of the enzyme, which is largely dictated by the rate of autophosphorylation for each isoform.",autophosphorylation,"Comparative analyses of the three-dimensional structures and enzymatic properties of alpha, beta, gamma and delta isoforms of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II.

P74646,23449916,Biochemical analysis of three putative KaiC clock proteins from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 suggests their functional divergence.,"Cyanobacteria have been shown to have a circadian clock system that consists mainly of three protein components: KaiA, KaiB and KaiC. This system is well understood in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, for which robust circadian oscillations have been shown. Like many other cyanobacteria, the chromosome of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains additional kaiC and kaiB gene copies besides the standard kaiABC gene cluster. The respective gene products differ significantly in their amino acid sequences, especially in their C-terminal regions, suggesting different functional characteristics. Here, phosphorylation assays of the three Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 KaiC proteins revealed that KaiC1 phosphorylation depends on KaiA, as is well documented for the Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 KaiC protein, whereas KaiC2 and KaiC3 autophosphorylate independently of KaiA. This was confirmed by in vivo protein-protein interaction studies, which demonstrate that only KaiC1 interacts with KaiA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the three different Kai proteins form only homomeric complexes in vivo. As only KaiC1 phosphorylation depends on KaiA, a prerequisite for robust oscillations, we suggest that the kaiAB1C1 gene cluster in Synechocystis sp.

Q9JK25,20519438,Phosphorylation controls autoinhibition of cytoplasmic linker protein-170.,"Cytoplasmic linker protein (CLIP)-170 is a microtubule (MT) plus-end-tracking protein that regulates MT dynamics and links MT plus ends to different intracellular structures. We have shown previously that intramolecular association between the N and C termini results in autoinhibition of CLIP-170, thus altering its binding to MTs and the dynactin subunit p150(Glued) (J. Cell Biol. 2004: 166, 1003-1014). In this study, we demonstrate that conformational changes in CLIP-170 are regulated by phosphorylation that enhances the affinity between the N- and C-terminal domains. By using site-directed mutagenesis and phosphoproteomic analysis, we mapped the phosphorylation sites in the third serine-rich region of CLIP-170. A phosphorylation-deficient mutant of CLIP-170 displays an ""open"" conformation and a higher binding affinity for growing MT ends and p150(Glued) as compared with nonmutated protein, whereas a phosphomimetic mutant confined to the ""folded back"" conformation shows decreased MT association and does not interact with p150(Glued).

O00418,22216903,Identification of autophosphorylation sites in eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase.,"eEF2K [eEF2 (eukaryotic elongation factor 2) kinase] phosphorylates and inactivates the translation elongation factor eEF2. eEF2K is not a member of the main eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily, but instead belongs to a small group of so-called α-kinases. The activity of eEF2K is normally dependent upon Ca(2+) and calmodulin. eEF2K has previously been shown to undergo autophosphorylation, the stoichiometry of which suggested the existence of multiple sites. In the present study we have identified several autophosphorylation sites, including Thr(348), Thr(353), Ser(366) and Ser(445), all of which are highly conserved among vertebrate eEF2Ks. We also identified a number of other sites, including Ser(78), a known site of phosphorylation, and others, some of which are less well conserved. None of the sites lies in the catalytic domain, but three affect eEF2K activity. Mutation of Ser(78), Thr(348) and Ser(366) to a non-phosphorylatable alanine residue decreased eEF2K activity. Phosphorylation of Thr(348) was detected by immunoblotting after transfecting wild-type eEF2K into HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells, but not after transfection with a kinase-inactive construct, confirming that this is indeed a site of autophosphorylation. Thr(348) appears to be constitutively autophosphorylated in vitro. Interestingly, other recent data suggest that the corresponding residue in other α-kinases is also autophosphorylated and contributes to the activation of these enzymes [Crawley, Gharaei, Ye, Yang, Raveh, London, Schueler-Furman, Jia and Cote (2011) J.

Q65652,7871721,Autocatalytic processing of the 223-kDa protein of blueberry scorch carlavirus by a papain-like proteinase.,"The first open reading frame of the blueberry scorch carlavirus (BBScV) genome encodes a putative replication-associated protein of 223 kDa (p223). A pulse-chase analysis of viral RNA translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate revealed that p223 was proteolytically processed. Using a full-length ORF 1 cDNA clone in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction, we confirmed that the ORF 1 gene product of BBScV processes autocatalytically. From sequence alignments with phylogenetically related viruses, including tymoviruses, we predicted that p223 contained a papain-like proteinase domain with a putative catalytic cysteine994 and histidine1075. A second possible proteinase domain, which contained cysteine895 and histidine984 residues with similar spacing but was otherwise less similar to the viral papain-like proteinases, was identified immediately upstream of the predicted catalytic site. The cleavage site of the proteinase was predicted to be between the putative helicase and the polymerase domains, possibly between or close to glycine1472 and alanine1473. Supporting these predictions, deletion of the 2091 nucleotides encoding the C-terminal region of p223, which contained the putative RNA polymerase domain and the putative cleavage site of the polyprotein, abolished autoproteolysis. Deletion of the 2061 nucleotides encoding the N-terminal region, which contained the putative methyltransferase domain, did not affect autoproteolysis.

Despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria, several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of gram-positive Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., and Lactococcus spp. The genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. Nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence, none of which has been reported in the literature. More than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides, sugars, metal ions, and cofactors have been identified.

Q9ULD2,19690332,Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of T cell receptor signaling reveals system-wide modulation of protein-protein interactions.,"Protein phosphorylation events during T cell receptor (TCR) signaling control the formation of complexes among proteins proximal to the TCR, the activation of kinase cascades, and the activation of transcription factors; however, the mode and extent of the influence of phosphorylation in coordinating the diverse phenomena associated with T cell activation are unclear. Therefore, we used the human Jurkat T cell leukemia cell line as a model system and performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses of TCR signaling. We identified 10,665 unique phosphorylation sites, of which 696 showed TCR-responsive changes. In addition, we analyzed broad trends in phosphorylation data sets to uncover underlying mechanisms associated with T cell activation. We found that, upon stimulation of the TCR, phosphorylation events extensively targeted protein modules involved in all of the salient phenomena associated with T cell activation: patterning of surface proteins, endocytosis of the TCR, formation of the F-actin cup, inside-out activation of integrins, polarization of microtubules, production of cytokines, and alternative splicing of messenger RNA. Further, case-by-case analysis of TCR-responsive phosphorylation sites on proteins belonging to relevant functional modules together with network analysis allowed us to deduce that serine-threonine (S-T) phosphorylation modulated protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a system-wide fashion. We also provide experimental support for this inference by showing that phosphorylation of tubulin on six distinct serine residues abrogated PPIs during the assembly of microtubules. We propose that modulation of PPIs by stimulus-dependent changes in S-T phosphorylation state is a widespread phenomenon applicable to many other signaling systems.",,"Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of T cell receptor signaling reveals system-wide modulation of protein-protein interactions.

Further, case-by-case analysis of TCR-responsive phosphorylation sites on proteins belonging to relevant functional modules together with network analysis allowed us to deduce that serine-threonine (S-T) phosphorylation modulated protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a system-wide fashion. We also provide experimental support for this inference by showing that phosphorylation of tubulin on six distinct serine residues abrogated PPIs during the assembly of microtubules. We propose that modulation of PPIs by stimulus-dependent changes in S-T phosphorylation state is a widespread phenomenon applicable to many other signaling systems."
P35968,15815621,Generation and annotation of the DNA sequences of human chromosomes 2 and 4.,"Human chromosome 2 is unique to the human lineage in being the product of a head-to-head fusion of two intermediate-sized ancestral chromosomes. Chromosome 4 has received attention primarily related to the search for the Huntington's disease gene, but also for genes associated with Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome, polycystic kidney disease and a form of muscular dystrophy. Here we present approximately 237 million base pairs of sequence for chromosome 2, and 186 million base pairs for chromosome 4, representing more than 99.6% of their euchromatic sequences. Our initial analyses have identified 1,346 protein-coding genes and 1,239 pseudogenes on chromosome 2, and 796 protein-coding genes and 778 pseudogenes on chromosome 4. Extensive analyses confirm the underlying construction of the sequence, and expand our understanding of the structure and evolution of mammalian chromosomes, including gene deserts, segmental duplications and highly variant regions.",,"Generation and annotation of the DNA sequences of human chromosomes 2 and 4.

Q7UC29,12384590,Genome sequence of Shigella flexneri 2a: insights into pathogenicity through comparison with genomes of Escherichia coli K12 and O157.,"We have sequenced the genome of Shigella flexneri serotype 2a, the most prevalent species and serotype that causes bacillary dysentery or shigellosis in man. The whole genome is composed of a 4 607 203 bp chromosome and a 221 618 bp virulence plasmid, designated pCP301. While the plasmid shows minor divergence from that sequenced in serotype 5a, striking characteristics of the chromosome have been revealed. The S.flexneri chromosome has, astonishingly, 314 IS elements, more than 7-fold over those possessed by its close relatives, the non-pathogenic K12 strain and enterohemorrhagic O157:H7 strain of Escherichia coli. There are 13 translocations and inversions compared with the E.coli sequences, all involve a segment larger than 5 kb, and most are associated with deletions or acquired DNA sequences, of which several are likely to be bacteriophage-transmitted pathogenicity islands. Furthermore, S.flexneri, resembling another human-restricted enteric pathogen, Salmonella typhi, also has hundreds of pseudogenes compared with the E.coli strains. All of these could be subjected to investigations towards novel preventative and treatment strategies against shigellosis.",,"Genome sequence of Shigella flexneri 2a: insights into pathogenicity through comparison with genomes of Escherichia coli K12 and O157.

C1K5M2,23757397,Evolution of a complex locus for terpene biosynthesis in solanum.,"Functional gene clusters, containing two or more genes encoding different enzymes for the same pathway, are sometimes observed in plant genomes, most often when the genes specify the synthesis of specialized defensive metabolites. Here, we show that a cluster of genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; Solanaceae) contains genes for terpene synthases (TPSs) that specify the synthesis of monoterpenes and diterpenes from cis-prenyl diphosphates, substrates that are synthesized by enzymes encoded by cis-prenyl transferase (CPT) genes also located within the same cluster. The monoterpene synthase genes in the cluster likely evolved from a diterpene synthase gene in the cluster by duplication and divergence. In the orthologous cluster in Solanum habrochaites, a new sesquiterpene synthase gene was created by a duplication event of a monoterpene synthase followed by a localized gene conversion event directed by a diterpene synthase gene. The TPS genes in the Solanum cluster encoding cis-prenyl diphosphate-utilizing enzymes are closely related to a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum; Solanaceae) diterpene synthase encoding Z-abienol synthase (Nt-ABS). Nt-ABS uses the substrate copal-8-ol diphosphate, which is made from the all-trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate by copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase (Nt-CPS2). The Solanum gene cluster also contains an ortholog of Nt-CPS2, but it appears to encode a nonfunctional protein. Thus, the Solanum functional gene cluster evolved by duplication and divergence of TPS genes, together with alterations in substrate specificity to utilize cis-prenyl diphosphates and through the acquisition of CPT genes.",,"Evolution of a complex locus for terpene biosynthesis in solanum.

P57751,27862469,Araport11: a complete reannotation of the Arabidopsis thaliana reference genome.,"The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a dicot model organism for research in many aspects of plant biology. A comprehensive annotation of its genome paves the way for understanding the functions and activities of all types of transcripts, including mRNA, the various classes of non-coding RNA, and small RNA. The TAIR10 annotation update had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research but was released more than 5 years ago. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48 359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of non-coding RNA including microRNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and small RNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identified 635 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5178 non-coding RNAs, and 35 846 small RNA loci that were formerly unannotated. Analysis of the splicing events and RNA-Seq based expression profiles revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43% of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes.

A. borkumensis SK2 has a streamlined genome with a paucity of mobile genetic elements and energy generation-related genes, but with a plethora of genes accounting for its wide hydrocarbon substrate range and efficient oil-degradation capabilities. The genome further specifies systems for scavenging of nutrients, particularly organic and inorganic nitrogen and oligo-elements, biofilm formation at the oil-water interface, biosurfactant production and niche-specific stress responses.

P52788,23696453,A Y328C missense mutation in spermine synthase causes a mild form of Snyder-Robinson syndrome.,"Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS, OMIM: 309583) is an X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) syndrome, characterized by a collection of clinical features including facial asymmetry, marfanoid habitus, hypertonia, osteoporosis and unsteady gait. It is caused by a significant decrease or loss of spermine synthase (SMS) activity. Here, we report a new missense mutation, p.Y328C (c.1084A>G), in SMS in a family with XLID. The affected males available for evaluation had mild ID, speech and global delay, an asthenic build, short stature with long fingers and mild kyphosis. The spermine/spermidine ratio in lymphoblasts was 0.53, significantly reduced compared with normal (1.87 average). Activity analysis of SMS in the index patient failed to detect any activity above background. In silico modeling demonstrated that the Y328C mutation has a significant effect on SMS stability, resulting in decreased folding free energy and larger structural fluctuations compared with those of wild-type SMS. The loss of activity was attributed to the increase in conformational dynamics in the mutant which affects the active site geometry, rather than preventing dimer formation. Taken together, the biochemical and in silico studies confirm the p.Y328C mutation in SMS is responsible for the patients having a mild form of SRS and reveal yet another molecular mechanism resulting in a non-functional SMS causing SRS.",,"A Y328C missense mutation in spermine synthase causes a mild form of Snyder-Robinson syndrome.

Here we report the isolation of mu-conotoxins SIIIA and SIIIB by (125)I-TIIIA-guided fractionation of milked Conus striatus venom. SIIIA and SIIIB potently displaced (125)I-TIIIA from native rat brain Na(v)1.2 (IC(50) values 10 and 5 nm, respectively) and muscle Na(v)1.4 (IC(50) values 60 and 3 nm, respectively) VGSCs, and both inhibited current through Xenopus oocyte-expressed Na(v)1.2 and Na(v)1.4. An alanine scan of SIIIA-(2-20), a pyroglutamate-truncated analogue with enhanced neuronal activity, revealed residues important for affinity and selectivity. Alanine replacement of the solvent-exposed Trp-12, Arg-14, His-16, Arg-18 resulted in large reductions in SIIIA-(2-20) affinity, with His-16 replacement affecting structure. In contrast, [D15A]SIIIA-(2-20) had significantly enhanced neuronal affinity (IC(50) 0.65 nm), while the double mutant [D15A/H16R]SIIIA-(2-20) showed greatest Na(v)1.2 versus 1.4 selectivity (136-fold). (1)H NMR studies revealed that SIIIA adopted a single conformation in solution comprising a series of turns and an alpha-helical motif across residues 11-16 that is not found in larger mu-conotoxins.
