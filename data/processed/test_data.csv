P00519,16543148,Organization of the SH3-SH2 unit in active and inactive forms of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase.,"The tyrosine kinase c-Abl is inactivated by interactions made by its SH3 and SH2 domains with the distal surface of the kinase domain. We present a crystal structure of a fragment of c-Abl which reveals that a critical N-terminal cap segment, not visualized in previous structures, buttresses the SH3-SH2 substructure in the autoinhibited state and locks it onto the distal surface of the kinase domain. Surprisingly, the N-terminal cap is phosphorylated on a serine residue that interacts with the connector between the SH3 and SH2 domains. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis shows that a mutated form of c-Abl, in which the N-terminal cap and two other key contacts in the autoinhibited state are deleted, exists in an extended array of the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains. This alternative conformation of Abl is likely to prolong the active state of the kinase by preventing it from returning to the autoinhibited state.",0,autoinhibition,"Organization of the SH3-SH2 unit in active and inactive forms of the c-Abl tyrosine kinase.

Q9Y4W6,37917749,Autoregulatory control of mitochondrial glutathione homeostasis.,"Mitochondria must maintain adequate amounts of metabolites for protective and biosynthetic functions. However, how mitochondria sense the abundance of metabolites and regulate metabolic homeostasis is not well understood. In this work, we focused on glutathione (GSH), a critical redox metabolite in mitochondria, and identified a feedback mechanism that controls its abundance through the mitochondrial GSH transporter, SLC25A39. Under physiological conditions, SLC25A39 is rapidly degraded by mitochondrial protease AFG3L2. Depletion of GSH dissociates AFG3L2 from SLC25A39, causing a compensatory increase in mitochondrial GSH uptake. Genetic and proteomic analyses identified a putative iron-sulfur cluster in the matrix-facing loop of SLC25A39 as essential for this regulation, coupling mitochondrial iron homeostasis to GSH import. Altogether, our work revealed a paradigm for the autoregulatory control of metabolic homeostasis in organelles.",0,autoregulation,"Autoregulatory control of mitochondrial glutathione homeostasis.

Nonetheless, amide bond N-methylations incorporated as post-translational modifications are scarce in nature and were first demonstrated in 2017 for a single set of fungal metabolites. Here we expand on our previous discovery of iterative, autocatalytic α- N-methylating precursor proteins in the borosin family of ribosomally encoded peptide natural products. We identify over 50 putative pathways in a variety of ascomycete and basidiomycete fungi and functionally validate nearly a dozen new self-α- N-methylating catalysts. Significant differences in precursor size, architecture, and core peptide properties subdivide this new peptide family into three discrete structural types.

B0FLN1,18281398,Isolation and characterization of an autoinducer synthase from Acinetobacter baumannii.,"The opportunistic human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii strain M2 was found to produce distinct acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals based on the use of an Agrobacterium tumefaciens traG-lacZ biosensor. An A. baumannii gene, designated abaI, was cloned and directed AHL production in recombinant Escherichia coli. The AbaI protein was similar to members of the LuxI family of autoinducer synthases and was predicted to be the only autoinducer synthase encoded by A. baumannii. The primary AHL signal directed by AbaI was identified by mass spectrometry as being N-(3-hydroxydodecanoyl)-L-HSL (3-hydroxy-C(12)-HSL). Minor amounts of at least five additional AHLs were also identified.

Q2G2U4,17827301,New insights into the WalK/WalR (YycG/YycF) essential signal transduction pathway reveal a major role in controlling cell wall metabolism and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.,"The highly conserved WalK/WalR (also known as YycG/YycF) two-component system is specific to low-G+C gram-positive bacteria. While this system is essential for cell viability, both the nature of its regulon and its physiological role have remained mostly uncharacterized. We observed that, unexpectedly, Staphylococcus aureus cell death induced by WalKR depletion was not followed by lysis. We show that WalKR positively controls autolytic activity, in particular that of the two major S. aureus autolysins, AtlA and LytM. By using our previously characterized consensus WalR binding site and carefully reexamining the genome annotations, we identified nine genes potentially belonging to the WalKR regulon that appeared to be involved in S. aureus cell wall degradation. Expression of all of these genes was positively controlled by WalKR levels in the cell, leading to high resistance to Triton X-100-induced lysis when the cells were starved for WalKR. Cells lacking WalKR were also more resistant to lysostaphin-induced lysis, suggesting modifications in cell wall structure. Indeed, lowered levels of WalKR led to a significant decrease in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and turnover and to cell wall modifications, which included increased peptidoglycan cross-linking and glycan chain length. We also demonstrated a direct relationship between WalKR levels and the ability to form biofilms. This is the first example in S. aureus of a regulatory system positively controlling autolysin synthesis and biofilm formation. Taken together, our results now define this signal transduction pathway as a master regulatory system for cell wall metabolism, which we have accordingly renamed WalK/WalR to reflect its true function.",0,autolysis,"New insights into the WalK/WalR (YycG/YycF) essential signal transduction pathway reveal a major role in controlling cell wall metabolism and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus.

P00520,20072125,Targeting Bcr-Abl by combining allosteric with ATP-binding-site inhibitors.,"In an effort to find new pharmacological modalities to overcome resistance to ATP-binding-site inhibitors of Bcr-Abl, we recently reported the discovery of GNF-2, a selective allosteric Bcr-Abl inhibitor. Here, using solution NMR, X-ray crystallography, mutagenesis and hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry, we show that GNF-2 binds to the myristate-binding site of Abl, leading to changes in the structural dynamics of the ATP-binding site. GNF-5, an analogue of GNF-2 with improved pharmacokinetic properties, when used in combination with the ATP-competitive inhibitors imatinib or nilotinib, suppressed the emergence of resistance mutations in vitro, displayed additive inhibitory activity in biochemical and cellular assays against T315I mutant human Bcr-Abl and displayed in vivo efficacy against this recalcitrant mutant in a murine bone-marrow transplantation model.

Q8RXD3,15998807,The AIP2 E3 ligase acts as a novel negative regulator of ABA signaling by promoting ABI3 degradation.,"The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) mediates many complex aspects of plant development including seed maturation, dormancy, and germination as well as root growth. The B3-domain transcription factor abscisic acid-insensitive 3 (ABI3) is a central regulator in ABA signaling, but little is known of how this factor is regulated. Here, we show that ABI3 is an unstable protein and that an ABI3-interacting protein (AIP2), which contains a RING motif, can polyubiquitinate ABI3 in vitro. The AIP2 E3 ligase activity is abolished by mutations (C230S; C231S) in the RING motif and the AIP2 (C/S) mutant functions in a dominant-negative manner. AIP2 has a stronger binding affinity for the B2 + B3 domain of ABI3 than the A1 + B1 domain, but only ubiquitinates the latter. In double-transgenic plants, induced AIP2 expression leads to a decrease in ABI3 protein levels. In contrast, ABI3 levels are elevated upon induced expression of the AIP2 RING mutant, which interferes with the endogenous AIP2 E3 activity. An aip2-1-null mutant shows higher ABI3 protein levels compared with wild type after seed stratification, and is hypersensitive to ABA, mimicking the ABI3-overexpression phenotype, whereas AIP2-overexpression plants contain lower levels of ABI3 protein than wild type and are more resistant to ABA, phenocopying abi3.

P06213,12707268,Structural and biochemical evidence for an autoinhibitory role for tyrosine 984 in the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor.,"Tyrosine 984 in the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor, between the transmembrane helix and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain, is conserved among all insulin receptor-like proteins from hydra to humans. Crystallographic studies of the tyrosine kinase domain and proximal juxtamembrane region reveal that Tyr-984 interacts with several other conserved residues in the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, stabilizing a catalytically nonproductive position of alpha-helix C. Steady-state kinetics measurements on the soluble kinase domain demonstrate that replacement of Tyr-984 with phenylalanine results in a 4-fold increase in kcat in the unphosphorylated (basal state) enzyme. Moreover, mutation of Tyr-984 in the full-length insulin receptor results in significantly elevated receptor phosphorylation levels in cells, both in the absence of insulin and following insulin stimulation. These data demonstrate that Tyr-984 plays an important structural role in maintaining the quiescent, basal state of the insulin receptor. In addition, the structural studies suggest a possible target site for small molecule activators of the insulin receptor, with potential use in the treatment of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",0,"autoinhibition,  autophosphorylation","Structural and biochemical evidence for an autoinhibitory role for tyrosine 984 in the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor.

Q06486,7665585,Role of COOH-terminal phosphorylation in the regulation of casein kinase I delta.,"Casein kinase I delta is a member of the casein kinase I (CKI) family, a group of second messenger independent protein kinases. We present evidence that the COOH-terminal domain of CKI delta has regulatory properties. CKI delta expressed in Escherichia coli was activated by heparin, as found previously, and by treatment with the catalytic subunit of type-1 protein phosphatase (CS1). Concomitant with activation by CS1, there was a reduction in the apparent molecular weight of CKI delta from 55,000 to 49,000 as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Truncation of CKI delta by removal of the COOH-terminal 110 amino acids eliminated the ability of CS1 to activate or to increase electrophoretic mobility. Casein kinase I alpha, a 37-kDa isoform that lacks an extended COOH-terminal domain, was not activated by CS1 or the presence of heparin. However, a chimeric enzyme consisting of CKI alpha fused to the COOH-terminal domain of CKI delta was activated by both heparin and CS1. Analysis of the effects of CS1 on a series of CKI delta COOH-terminal truncation mutants identified an inhibitory region between His317 and Pro342, which contained six potential phosphorylation sites. From analysis of the specific activites of these truncation mutants, removal of the same region resulted in enzyme with a specific activity nearly 10-fold greater than wild-type. Thus, CKI delta activity can be regulated by phosphorylation of its COOH terminus, which may serve to create an autoinhibitory domain.

Kinase domain structures of two other VRK family members (VRK2 and VRK3) have been determined previously. However, the structure of VRK1, the most extensively studied and constitutively active VRK member, is yet to be characterized. Here, we present the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) solution structure of a catalytically active form of human VRK1 with its extended C-terminal tail (residues 1-361). The NMR structure of human VRK1 reveals that the C-terminal tail orients toward the catalytic site and forms a number of interactions that are critical for structural stability and catalysis. The role of this unique C-terminal tail was further investigated by deletion mutant studies where deletion of the terminal tail resulted in a dramatic reduction in the autocatalytic activity of VRK1. NMR titration studies carried out with ATP or an ATP analog confirm that ATP/ATP analogs interact with all of the crucial residues present in important motifs of the protein kinase such as the hinge region, catalytic loop, DYG motif, and thereby suggest that the catalytic domain of VRK1 is not atypical.

Previous studies have mostly targeted members of the NEDD4 subfamily for structural and functional analysis. The UBE3C E3 ligase is a member of the 'other' subfamily HECT and influences several crucial cellular processes, including innate immunity, proteasome processivity, and cancer metastasis.

The UBE3C HECT domain forms an open, L-shaped, bilobed conformation, having a large N-lobe and a small C-lobe. We show that the N-terminal region (aa 693-743) preceding the UBE3C HECT domain as well as a loop region (aa 758-762) in the N-lobe of the HECT domain affect the stability and activity of UBE3C HECT domain.

Additional transcription initiation sites were located within a CpG-rich region proximal to the ATG. The transcription initiation site of the PKC gamma gene was identified by primed cDNA synthesis. In transfection experiments, the PKC gamma promoter was expressed at high level in U937 and HL60 cells but not in COS-1 cells. A sequence motif (AnAGATTCanAGAGnCa), reiterated over at least 1 kb, was located approximately 1.5 kb 5' of the PKC gamma translation initiation codon. This repetitive motif is abundant in run-on RNA in the hematopoietic and epithelial cell lines tested. Analysis of promoter deletion constructs by transient transcription assays in U937, IM9, and COS-1 cells showed negative regulation of the PKC beta promoter by sequences located between -3,000 and -690. although no homology between PKC beta and PKC-gamma 5'-flanking sequences was observed, both PKC beta and PKC gamma promoters were potently induced by 12-phorbol 13-myristate in transfected U937 cells."
Q8IYU2,38332367,Structural mechanisms of autoinhibition and substrate recognition by the ubiquitin ligase HACE1.,"Ubiquitin ligases (E3s) are pivotal specificity determinants in the ubiquitin system by selecting substrates and decorating them with distinct ubiquitin signals. However, structure determination of the underlying, specific E3-substrate complexes has proven challenging owing to their transient nature. In particular, it is incompletely understood how members of the catalytic cysteine-driven class of HECT-type ligases (HECTs) position substrate proteins for modification. Here, we report a cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the full-length human HECT HACE1, along with solution-based conformational analyses by small-angle X-ray scattering and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Structure-based functional analyses in vitro and in cells reveal that the activity of HACE1 is stringently regulated by dimerization-induced autoinhibition. The inhibition occurs at the first step of the catalytic cycle and is thus substrate-independent. We use mechanism-based chemical crosslinking to reconstitute a complex of activated, monomeric HACE1 with its major substrate, RAC1, determine its structure by cryo-EM and validate the binding mode by solution-based analyses. Our findings explain how HACE1 achieves selectivity in ubiquitinating the active, GTP-loaded state of RAC1 and establish a framework for interpreting mutational alterations of the HACE1-RAC1 interplay in disease. More broadly, this work illuminates central unexplored aspects in the architecture, conformational dynamics, regulation and specificity of full-length HECTs.",1,"autoinhibition,  autoubiquitination","Structural mechanisms of autoinhibition and substrate recognition by the ubiquitin ligase HACE1.

O64517,21209078,Calcium-dependent activation and autolysis of Arabidopsis metacaspase 2d.,"Metacaspases (MCPs) are members of a new family of cysteine proteases found in plants, fungi, and protozoa that are structurally related to metazoan caspases. Recent studies showed that plant MCPs are arginine/lysine-specific cysteine proteases with caspase-like processing activities in vitro and in vivo, and some of the plant type II MCPs exhibit Ca(2+) dependence for their endopeptidase activity in vitro. However, the mechanisms and biological relevance of Ca(2+) dependence and self-processing of plant MCPs remains unclear. Here we show that recombinant AtMCP2d, the most abundantly expressed member of Arabidopsis type II MCPs at the transcriptional level, exhibits a strict Ca(2+) dependence for its catalytic activation that is apparently mediated by intramolecular self-cleavage mechanism. However, rapid inactivation of AtMCP2d activity concomitant with Ca(2+)-induced self-processing at multiple internal sites was observed. Because active AtMCP2d can cleave its inactive form, intermolecular cleavage (autolysis) of AtMCP2d could also occur under our assay conditions. Ca(2+)-induced self-processing of recombinant AtMCP2d was found to correlate with the sequential appearance of at least six intermediates, including self-cleaved forms, during the proenzyme purification process. Six of these peptides were characterized, and the cleavage sites were mapped through N-terminal protein sequencing. Mutation analysis of AtMCP2d revealed that cleavage after Lys-225, which is a highly conserved residue among the six Arabidopsis type II MCPs, is critical for the catalytic activation by Ca(2+), and we demonstrate that this residue is essential for AtMCP2d activation of H(2)O(2)-induced cell death in yeast. Together, our results provide clues to understand the mode of regulation for this class of proteases.",1,"autocatalysis,  autolysis","Calcium-dependent activation and autolysis of Arabidopsis metacaspase 2d.

Q8RG52,11889109,Genome sequence and analysis of the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum strain ATCC 25586.,"We present a complete DNA sequence and metabolic analysis of the dominant oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum. Although not considered a major dental pathogen on its own, this anaerobe facilitates the aggregation and establishment of several other species including the dental pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus. The F. nucleatum strain ATCC 25586 genome was assembled from shotgun sequences and analyzed using the ERGO bioinformatics suite (http://www.integratedgenomics.com). The genome contains 2.17 Mb encoding 2,067 open reading frames, organized on a single circular chromosome with 27% GC content. Despite its taxonomic position among the gram-negative bacteria, several features of its core metabolism are similar to that of gram-positive Clostridium spp., Enterococcus spp., and Lactococcus spp. The genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism. Nine very-high-molecular-weight outer membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence, none of which has been reported in the literature. More than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides, sugars, metal ions, and cofactors have been identified. Biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids: glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine. The remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm. A principal source of energy appears to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate. Additionally, desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia, H(2)S, methyl mercaptan, and butyrate, which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth, thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium. The metabolic capabilities of F. nucleatum revealed by its genome are therefore consistent with its specialized niche in the mouth.",0,,"Genome sequence and analysis of the oral bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum strain ATCC 25586.

Q9ULD2,19690332,Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of T cell receptor signaling reveals system-wide modulation of protein-protein interactions.,"Protein phosphorylation events during T cell receptor (TCR) signaling control the formation of complexes among proteins proximal to the TCR, the activation of kinase cascades, and the activation of transcription factors; however, the mode and extent of the influence of phosphorylation in coordinating the diverse phenomena associated with T cell activation are unclear. Therefore, we used the human Jurkat T cell leukemia cell line as a model system and performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses of TCR signaling. We identified 10,665 unique phosphorylation sites, of which 696 showed TCR-responsive changes. In addition, we analyzed broad trends in phosphorylation data sets to uncover underlying mechanisms associated with T cell activation. We found that, upon stimulation of the TCR, phosphorylation events extensively targeted protein modules involved in all of the salient phenomena associated with T cell activation: patterning of surface proteins, endocytosis of the TCR, formation of the F-actin cup, inside-out activation of integrins, polarization of microtubules, production of cytokines, and alternative splicing of messenger RNA. Further, case-by-case analysis of TCR-responsive phosphorylation sites on proteins belonging to relevant functional modules together with network analysis allowed us to deduce that serine-threonine (S-T) phosphorylation modulated protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in a system-wide fashion. We also provide experimental support for this inference by showing that phosphorylation of tubulin on six distinct serine residues abrogated PPIs during the assembly of microtubules. We propose that modulation of PPIs by stimulus-dependent changes in S-T phosphorylation state is a widespread phenomenon applicable to many other signaling systems.",0,,"Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of T cell receptor signaling reveals system-wide modulation of protein-protein interactions.

C1K5M2,23757397,Evolution of a complex locus for terpene biosynthesis in solanum.,"Functional gene clusters, containing two or more genes encoding different enzymes for the same pathway, are sometimes observed in plant genomes, most often when the genes specify the synthesis of specialized defensive metabolites. Here, we show that a cluster of genes in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum; Solanaceae) contains genes for terpene synthases (TPSs) that specify the synthesis of monoterpenes and diterpenes from cis-prenyl diphosphates, substrates that are synthesized by enzymes encoded by cis-prenyl transferase (CPT) genes also located within the same cluster. The monoterpene synthase genes in the cluster likely evolved from a diterpene synthase gene in the cluster by duplication and divergence. In the orthologous cluster in Solanum habrochaites, a new sesquiterpene synthase gene was created by a duplication event of a monoterpene synthase followed by a localized gene conversion event directed by a diterpene synthase gene. The TPS genes in the Solanum cluster encoding cis-prenyl diphosphate-utilizing enzymes are closely related to a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum; Solanaceae) diterpene synthase encoding Z-abienol synthase (Nt-ABS). Nt-ABS uses the substrate copal-8-ol diphosphate, which is made from the all-trans geranylgeranyl diphosphate by copal-8-ol diphosphate synthase (Nt-CPS2).
